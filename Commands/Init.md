# git init
The 'git init' command is used to create an empty git respository.

If you wanted to create a new directory and initialize a git repository, you can do so with the following commands:
```
mkdir NewDirectory
cd NewDirectory
git init
```

Once inside a git repository, you can start using commands such as
[status](./Status.md),
[add](./Add.md),
[commit](./Commit.md),
[push](./Push.md)
and more.

Init will create the repository in the current directory and will encapsulat all content, including other directories.
